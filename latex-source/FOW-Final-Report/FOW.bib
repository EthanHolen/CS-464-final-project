  abstract  = {Augmented Reality (AR) gains increased attention as a means to provide assistance for different human activities. Hereby the suitability of AR does not only depend on the respective task, but also to a high degree on the respective device. In a standardized assembly task, we tested AR-based in-situ assistance against conventional pictorial instructions using a smartphone, Microsoft HoloLens and Epson Moverio BT-200 smart glasses as well as paper-based instructions. Participants solved the task fastest using the paper instructions, but made less errors with AR assistance on the Microsoft HoloLens smart glasses than with any other system. Methodically we propose operational definitions of time segments and other optimizations for standardized benchmarking of AR assembly instructions.},

abstract = {Objective
The medical world is continuously evolving, with techniques being created or improved almost daily. Immersive virtual reality (VR) is a technology that could be harnessed to develop tools that meet the educational challenges of this changing environment. We previously described the immersive tutorial, a 3D video (filmed from the first-person point of view), displayed on a VR application. This tool offers access to supplementary educational data in addition to the video. Here we attempt to assess improvement in learning a technique using this new educational format.
Material and methods
We selected a single neurosurgical technique for the study: external ventricular drainage. We wrote a technical note describing this procedure and produced the corresponding immersive tutorial. We conducted a prospective randomized comparative study with students. All participants read the technical note, and one group used the immersive tutorial as a teaching supplement. The students completed a multiple-choice questionnaire immediately after the training and again at six months.
Results
One hundred seventy-six fourth-year medical students participated in the study; 173 were included in assessing the immediate learning outcomes and 72 were included at the six-month follow-up. The VR group demonstrated significantly better short-term results than the control group (P=0.01). The same trend was seen at six months.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this study presents one of the largest cohorts for VR. The use of the immersive tutorial could enable a large number of healthcare professionals to be trained without the need for expensive equipment.
Résumé
Objectifs
Le monde médical ne cesse d’évoluer avec notamment une multiplication des techniques de soins. La réalité virtuelle immersive (VR), pourrait permettre le développement d’outils qui répondent aux enjeux pédagogiques. Nous avions préalablement décrit le tutoriel immersif. Il s’agit d’une vidéo 3D (filmée en point de vue à la première personne), projetée dans une application VR. Cet outil offre en supplément du film, un accès à d’autres données pédagogiques. L’objectif de notre étude est d’évaluer l’amélioration de la mémorisation d’une technique en utilisant ce nouveau format pédagogique.
Matériel et méthode
Nous avons sélectionné une technique opératoire neurochirurgicale : la dérivation ventriculaire externe. Nous avons rédigé une note technique décrivant cette procédure et avons produit le tutoriel immersif correspondant. Une étude randomisée prospective comparative a été réalisée auprès d’étudiants. Tous ont lu la note technique, un groupe utilisait en supplément pédagogique le tutoriel immersif. Les étudiants ont rempli un questionnaire à choix multiple immédiatement après la formation et à six mois.
Résultats
Cent soixante seize étudiants en quatrième année de médecine ont participé à l’étude, 173 ont été inclus pour évaluer la restitution immédiate des connaissances. Ils étaient 72 à six mois. Le groupe VR a significativement apporté de meilleures réponses à court terme par rapport au groupe contrôle (p=0,01), La même tendance est retrouvée à six mois.
Conclusion
À notre connaissance, ce travail présente l’une des plus grandes cohortes étudiant la VR. L’utilisation du tutoriel immersif pourrait permettre, sans équipements onéreux, de former en grand nombre des professionnels de santé.}
