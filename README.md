# CS-464-final-project


*By: Ethan Holen*


Final research project for CS-464 Human Computer Interaction.



## Project Description

With augmented reality (AR) devices becoming cheaper and more common in the home and workplace, the range of potential uses for it in everyday life has expanded. One of the areas which AR can now assist in is aiding in physical construction or assembly tasks. Previously users have had to read instructions or watch videos to learn how to put together a new piece of furniture or appliance. This can be challenging especially when working with small or fragile components, and can prove expensive if pieces are broken. Along with the mental cost of context switching between the video or tutorial and the task at hand. With the ever increasing availability of AR, the potential for virtual tutorials in which a user could go step by step through the building process virtually are now available. This experiment seeks to examine ways in which instructions in AR could improve upon the current instruction types.

This can now potentially include helping with daily tasks such as tutorials to help with building physical object such as furniture or new appliances. Instead of the user watching a video on their smartphone and building the object at the same time, they could now have the opportunity to be guided through the process with a digital overlay of the task in AR. This style of tutorial could minimize context switching, helping to minimize errors and maximize speed in completing simple at home construction projects.

The purpose of this experiment is to explore the benefits of different instruction types within an AR environment.
